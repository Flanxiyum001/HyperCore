## About HyperCore
HyperCore is a decentralized global AI network designed to empower individuals and businesses with cutting-edge technology. It leverages advanced machine learning models to automate processes, optimize workflows, and create efficient solutions for modern problems. HyperCore aims to provide scalable, secure, and reliable AI services that can be accessed by anyone globally.

## Features
- **Decentralization**: Built on a decentralized architecture, ensuring no single point of failure.
- **Real-time Data**: Allows real-time communication through WebSocket connections for continuous data exchange.
- **AI-powered**: Uses machine learning models for automated decision-making and anomaly detection.
- **Security**: User authentication and JWT-based security for API routes.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable to handle growing data and users, leveraging MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data storage.

## Getting Started
To get started with HyperCore, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **MongoDB Atlas** account
- **Web browser** for frontend access

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Flanxiyum001/HyperCore.git
    cd HyperCore
    ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
    From the `backend` directory, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up MongoDB**:
    Ensure you have a MongoDB Atlas account and replace the `mongoURI` in `backend/server.js` with your MongoDB connection string.

4. **Start the Backend**:
    Run the server to start the backend:
    ```bash
    node backend/server.js
    ```

5. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
    From the `frontend` directory, install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

6. **Start the Frontend**:
    Run the frontend using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Now, your application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend API at `http://localhost:5000`.
