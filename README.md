About HyperCore
HyperCore is a decentralized global AI network designed to empower individuals and businesses with cutting-edge technology. It leverages advanced machine learning models to automate processes, optimize workflows, and create efficient solutions for modern problems. HyperCore aims to provide scalable, secure, and reliable AI services that can be accessed by anyone globally.

Features
Decentralization: Built on a decentralized architecture, ensuring no single point of failure.
Real-time Data: Allows real-time communication through WebSocket connections for continuous data exchange.
AI-powered: Uses machine learning models for automated decision-making and anomaly detection.
Security: User authentication and JWT-based security for API routes.
Scalability: Easily scalable to handle growing data and users, leveraging MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data storage.
Getting Started
To get started with HyperCore, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (>= 14.x)
MongoDB Atlas account
Web browser for frontend access
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Flanxiyum001/HyperCore.git
cd HyperCore
Install Backend Dependencies: From the backend directory, install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Set Up MongoDB: Ensure you have a MongoDB Atlas account and replace the mongoURI in backend/server.js with your MongoDB connection string.

Start the Backend: Run the server to start the backend:

bash
Copy code
node backend/server.js
Install Frontend Dependencies: From the frontend directory, install the dependencies:

bash
